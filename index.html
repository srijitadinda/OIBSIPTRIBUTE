                    Ten months later, while returning from a market, Laxmi was attacked by Naeem and his older brother Kamran, who called her name and threw acid on her face from a motorcycle.
                     Laxmi fainted and faced multiple accidents while trying to seek help. Arun Singh, a passerby, took her to the hospital where the police were informed.

                     However, due to widespread protests and media attention, he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.</p></td>
